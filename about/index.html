		<h1>Our vision is to create a compassionate society that provides safety, refuge and protection for all animals.</h1>

		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p> Karma Rescue is a non-profit organization dedicated to saving animals in need by finding them permanent homes and providing the resources for successful companionship. Through education, we instill the critical need for spay/neuter and offer guidance to strengthen the animal-human bond. </p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p class="by">Rande Levine</p>
		<p class="title">Founder of Karma Rescue</p>

		<p>Sometimes when I look around the world, I can't help but see how things could be better. The same is true when I look into the eyes of a dog, or any animal. I started loving animals the day I was born. My mom always let me have pets growing up: birds, hamsters, rats, cats, dogs, and even a chicken. To me of course, these were not my pets but were my babies. If I could have put a diaper on my chicken, I would have. Growing up with animals helped me find a special place in my heart for their needs. One animal in particular was my dog Rufus. I adopted him when I was in college. Everyone thought I was crazy to get a dog at such an inopportune time of my life.</p>

		<p>Rufus and I did everything together. We never left each other's sides. We walked, talked, sang, played, laughed, criedâ€¦you name it. Raising him on my own was one of the greatest experiences of my life. It humbled me and taught me to give unconditionally. Every morning when I looked into his sweet eyes, I thought of how many more wonderful animals like Rufus were out there. Having been involved in rescue for some time, I have seen it everyday. I walk into the shelters and see those same eyes that Rufus had. I see the longing and the love these animals have for us. I see how they can add so much to our lives. As we all know, not all animals have the chance to teach the world this message. So I founded Karma Rescue to try to give as many of them as possible the chance to help better our lives by just being in them. They deserve it.</p>
