		<h1>Karma Rescue Foster Program</h1>

		<p>A vital part of the rescue process is fostering. By taking in a newly rescued dog, not only will you receive a very special gift of joy, but you also enable us to give another dog from the Los Angeles area shelters a second chance.</p>

		<h2>More Information</h2>
		<p>A vital part of the rescue process is fostering. A foster parent fulfills an integral role by providing the initial safe and secure environment for a rescued dog. By taking in a newly rescued dog, you enable us to pull another dog in need from the Los Angeles area shelters.

During the transition phase from shelter to home, rescued dogs require emotional support. A foster parent must provide a nurturing atmosphere that includes shelter, exercise, and most importantly, love. It takes a special person who can provide all of this for a rescued dog and then give them up when a permanent home is found.

Foster parents can also contribute immensely in placing rescued dogs in appropriately matched homes. By observing their fostered dog’s specific personality traits, we gather essential information necessary for placing each dog in the right home.</p>

		<h3>Testimonials About Fostering</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In the past year and a half my roommate and I have fostered six different dogs. Some were adults and others only a few months old. It's a serious commitment to make but we are extremely grateful for the experiences we've had because of these dogs. A lot of love and hard works goes into caring for another living being, however the rewards are amazing! You get to learn each dog's unique personality, watch them learn, and grow up right before your eyes. It's the best feeling when the dogs get adopted because you know that they have found a forever home, but will always have a place in your heart. Fostering is something that I find extremely rewarding, and I just love helping these little nuggets find their place in the world.</p>
